  # ! There is a bug with a missing symlink in all 3.1 versions of
  # ! "govuk_elements_rails". There is an open PR to fix this here:
  # ! https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements_rails/pull/38. However, the gem
  # ! has been deprecated and is no longer maintained, and because LR Common
  # ! Styles is a gem as well, we cannot use a forked repo as a dependency. As a
  # ! result we are stuck using version 3.0.2 until further investigations provide
  # ! a better solution.
